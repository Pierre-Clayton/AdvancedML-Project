# AdvancedML-Project
Group project for the Advanced Machine Learning course, by Pierre CLAYTON, Vincent GIMENES, Anna MOSAKI.

You will find our final notebook "Notebook-main-AML.ipynb" containing the code needed to reproduce the graphs and experiments showed in the report. 
The other ones are some of our work we did, not really convincing but we thought you still could be interested to see what we tried.
The report is also available here, under the name "report.pdf".
You won't need anything except python in some 3.7+ version to run the notebooks.

Thank you, and don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any question !
